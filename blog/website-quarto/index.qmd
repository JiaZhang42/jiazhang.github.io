<!-- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a multi-language (e.g., R, Python, Julia), next generation version of R Markdown from RStudio (rebranded as Posit recently). It can create reports, presentations, websites, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, etc. -->

<!-- I learned about Quarto from [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hashtag_click). Before that, I barely used R Markdown. I was more used to separating the result-generating process from publishing. My workflow was an R project (containing data, code, and output) plus a Latex folder. When I saw Quarto, I thought, this was the time to make a change. -->

<!-- Quarto has many unique features, such as a single `.qmd` file for all output formats. One can generate HTML, PDF, MS Word with a one-line change in the YAML. [Citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) are super easy, especially for people who also work with Zotero. Besides, as a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) user, I like all-in-one tools because there is always a universal logic underlying the diverse functions, then why bother to reinvent the wheel? -->

<!-- I first tried to use Quarto for my presentation because I was tired of Beamer. [Revealjs presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) created by Quarto are fantastic. Remember when you have to squeeze your table or figure into one slide only to find it too small for the audience? Revealjs gets you a scrollable slide. I also like the preview-links option, which allows one to open links without interrupting the presentation flow. Another convenient thing about Quarto is that you can copy and paste figures directly into the visual editor. With [all these features](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/demo/#/title-slide), the next step is to know some art about slide craft - how to put together slides that are functional and aesthetically pleasing. Emil Hvitfeldt keeps [an excellent blog](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/post/slidecraft-colors-fonts/) about this. -->

<!-- Soon after, I started to build this website with Quarto. As a complete novice, [Sam Csik's tutorial](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) helped me a lot! I also bought a lot from [Sam Csik's website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/). -->

<!-- I recently found an up-to-date list of [Quarto resources](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto). It is comprehensive and quality guaranteed. Why bother to write this blog? The reason is from a [blog post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) by Rachel Thomas: -->

The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you're writing about. -->

<!-- Researchers often think there is no need to write something of no contribution (i.e., adding no value to the existing literature), which is definitely true to some extent. But remember, we are in the best position to help people in our neighborhood who may have no access to the resources or see those resources but are frightened by jargon. -->

Are you looking for a new tool to build your personal website? [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the next generation version of R Markdown from Posit (formerly known as RStudio), is a great option to consider. Quarto allows you to create beautiful websites, reports, presentations, and books in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, and MS Word.

Not only does Quarto support multiple languages, such as R, Python, and Julia, but it also has a host of unique features that make it a versatile and powerful tool. For example, Quarto uses a single `.qmd` file for all output formats, so you can easily switch between them with just a one-line change in the YAML. [Citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) are a breeze, especially if you also use Zotero, and if you're a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) user, you'll appreciate the all-in-one approach of Quarto.

I first learned about Quarto through the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hashtag_click) community and was immediately impressed by its capabilities. Before using Quarto, I rarely used R Markdown and tended to separate the process of generating results from publishing them. My workflow consisted of an R project (containing data, code, and output) plus a separate Latex folder. But with Quarto, I was able to streamline my process and create more polished and professional outputs.

One of the standout features of Quarto is its ability to create [Revealjs presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/). If you're tired of struggling to fit your tables and figures onto a single slide in Beamer, you'll love the scrollable slides in Revealjs. And with the preview-links option, you can open links without interrupting the flow of your presentation. Plus, you can easily copy and paste figures directly into the visual editor.

If you're new to Quarto and unsure of where to start, don't worry. There are plenty of resources available to help you get started. [Sam Csik's tutorial](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) was particularly helpful for me to build this website, and I also found a comprehensive and [up-to-date list](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto) of Quarto resources that are guaranteed to be of high quality.

But why write this blog post in the first place? As [Rachel Thomas](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) explains,

> You are best positioned to help people one step behind you. The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner (or an intermediate) and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you're writing about.

As researchers, we often think that there's no point in writing something that doesn't contribute new knowledge to the existing literature. While that may be true to an extent, it's also important to remember that we're in the best position to help those in our community who may not have access to the same resources or who may be intimidated by jargon. So why not share your knowledge and experience with Quarto and help others build their own stunning personal websites?
