I discussed recent literature on four subtopics of meme trading including attention, network structure, social transmission biases, and narratives and interpretation. I highlighted their relations and listed the questions that await answering. I also provided a critical review of Cookson et al.(2022), which uses echo chambers, a type of social transmission bias, to explain persistent disagreement and high trading volume."

    "text": "Are you looking for a new tool to build your personal website? Quarto, the next generation version of R Markdown from Posit (formerly known as RStudio), is a great option to consider. Quarto allows you to create beautiful websites, reports, presentations, and books in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, and MS Word.\nNot only does Quarto support multiple languages, such as R, Python, and Julia, but it also has a host of unique features that make it a versatile and powerful tool. For example, Quarto uses a single .qmd file for all output formats, so you can easily switch between them with just a one-line change in the YAML. Citations are a breeze, especially if you also use Zotero, and if you’re a Notion user, you’ll appreciate the all-in-one approach of Quarto.\nI first learned about Quarto through the #rstats community and was immediately impressed by its capabilities. Before using Quarto, I rarely used R Markdown and tended to separate the process of generating results from publishing them. My workflow consisted of an R project (containing data, code, and output) plus a separate Latex folder. But with Quarto, I was able to streamline my process and create more polished and professional outputs.\nOne of the standout features of Quarto is its ability to create Revealjs presentations. If you’re tired of struggling to fit your tables and figures onto a single slide in Beamer, you’ll love the scrollable slides in Revealjs. And with the preview-links option, you can open links without interrupting the flow of your presentation. Plus, you can easily copy and paste figures directly into the visual editor.\nIf you’re new to Quarto and unsure of where to start, don’t worry. There are plenty of resources available to help you get started. Sam Csik’s tutorial was particularly helpful for me to build this website, and I also found a comprehensive and up-to-date list of Quarto resources that are guaranteed to be of high quality.\nBut why write this blog post in the first place? As Rachel Thomas explains,\n\nYou are best positioned to help people one step behind you. The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner (or an intermediate) and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you’re writing about.\n\nAs researchers, we often think that there’s no point in writing something that doesn’t contribute new knowledge to the existing literature. While that may be true to an extent, it’s also important to remember that we’re in the best position to help those in our community who may not have access to the same resources or who may be intimidated by jargon. So why not share your knowledge and experience with Quarto and help others build their own stunning personal websites?\nP.S. This post is re-generated by ChatGPT on December 4, 2022. I asked ChatGPT to revise my original post so that it reads like a friendly learner sharing knowledge, while avoid mansplaining.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{zhang2022,\n  author = {Jia Zhang},\n  title = {Use {Quarto} to {Build} {Your} {Personal} {Website}},\n  date = {2022-12-04},\n  url = {https://jiazhang42.github.io/mysite/blog/website-quarto/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJia Zhang. 2022. “Use Quarto to Build Your Personal\nWebsite.” December 4, 2022. https://jiazhang42.github.io/mysite/blog/website-quarto/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently read Introduction to Causal Inference from a Machine Learning Perspective by Brady Neal for fun. I’m familar with applied causal inference techniques such as IV, DID, and RDD, but I’m not familiar with causal graphs. So, I decided to start from Neal’s lecture notes when I saw the helpful flowchart he made:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn chapter 6, Neal introduces Pearl’s do-calculus, which allows us to identify any causal estimand that is identifiable as long as we have the correct causal graph. The three rules of do-calculus are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 6.2 (Rules of do-calculus)\n\n\n\nGiven a causal graph \\(G\\), an associated distribution \\(P\\), and disjoint sets of variables \\(Y, T, Z,\\) and \\(W\\), the following rules hold.\nRule 1: \\[\nP(y|do(t), z, w)=P(y|do(t), w) \\quad \\text{if} \\quad Y \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp_{G_\\bar{T}} Z | T,W\n\\] Rule 2: \\[\nP(y|do(t), do(z), w) = P(y|do(t), z, w) \\quad \\text{if} \\quad Y \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp_{G_{\\bar{T}, \\underline{Z}}} Z | T,W\n\\] Rule 3: \\[\nP(y|do(t), do(z), w) = P(y|do(t), w) \\quad \\text{if} \\quad Y \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp_{G_{\\bar{T}, \\bar{Z}(W)}} Z | T,W\n\\] where \\(Z(W)\\) denotes the sets of nodes of \\(Z\\) that aren’t ancestors of any node of \\(W\\) in \\(G_{\\bar{T}}\\).\n\n\nWithout rigorous proofs, it can be difficult to understand why these three rules are complete. At first, they seemed quite arbitrary to me, even with Neal’s explanation. I couldn’t see the connections among them. But after thinking about it more, I was able to gain some intuition that really helped me understand and remember them.\nThe goal of do-calculus is identification - turning causal estimand into statistical estimand. And the way to do this is to rely on conditional independence. We know that association can be divided into causal association and non-causal association. Therefore, we consider three types of independence:\n\nno association\nno non-causal association\nno causal association.\n\nThe three rules correspond to these three types of independence, respectively.\nRule 1 says if there is no association between \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) conditioning on some intervened variables \\(T\\) and observed variables \\(W\\), then we can remove \\(Z\\).\nRule 2 says if there is no non-causal association between \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) conditioning on some intervened variables \\(T\\) and observed variables \\(W\\), then we can transform \\(do(Z)\\) into \\(Z\\) (because causal association is the only association left). Note that causal association must flow though the edges going out of \\(Z\\), and by removing those edges, we focus on the non-causal independence.\nRule 3 says if there is no causal association between \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) conditioning on some intervened variables \\(T\\) and observed variables \\(W\\), then we can remove \\(do(Z)\\). Because we want to get rid of non-causal association in the graph, we remove all edges flowing into \\(Z\\). But note that when removing \\(do(Z)\\) from the conditioning set, we are recovering the inflow edges of \\(Z\\). And if \\(Z\\) contains colliders that are ancestors of \\(W\\), then conditioning on \\(W\\) (i.e., conditioning on the descendants of a collider) would introduce new association that can affect \\(Y\\). We don’t have this problem in Rule 2’s situation because if some variable wants to associate with \\(Y\\) through a collider in \\(Z\\), then \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) must have non-causal association, which violates our assumption (the if clause in Rule 2).\nTherefore, we need to divide \\(Z\\) into 2 categories: \\(Z(W)\\), nodes of \\(Z\\) that aren’t ancestors of \\(W\\), and the rest. For \\(Z(W)\\), we assume \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) have no causal association; for the rest, we assume they have no association, which is a stronger assumption.\nI hope this helps give you a better understanding of the three rules of do-calculus.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{zhang2023,\n  author = {Jia Zhang},\n  title = {Intuition for {Do-Calculus}},\n  date = {2023-01-01},\n  url = {https://jiazhang42.github.io/mysite/blog/do-calculus/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJia Zhang. 2023. “Intuition for Do-Calculus.” January 1,\n2023. https://jiazhang42.github.io/mysite/blog/do-calculus/."
