About this site

::: {#map layout="[55,5,40]" layout-valign="top"}

I feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love a lot right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time outdoors. Living in Hong Kong is a massive privilege and being here means that we have access to both the mountains and the sea, each a few minutes in either direction. It was the ocean that brought me here originally, but most of my free time is now spent on the trails.
