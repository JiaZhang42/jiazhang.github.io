I like:

-   science fiction

    -   My favorite authors include [Stanis≈Çaw Lem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem), [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams) and [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang).

-   cooking

    -   It helps me enter "flow state" (otherwise my life would be in danger). Besides, I cook well with recipes.

-   stand-up comedy and comedies in general

    -   my top-5 comedy show:
        -   [Louie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_(American_TV_series)) (by Louis C.K.)

        -   [Nathan for You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_for_You) (by Nathan Fielder)

        -   [Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)) (by Dan Harmon)

        -   [Black Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Books) (by Dylan Moran)

        -   [Fleabag Season 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag) (by Phoebe Waller-Bridge)

I don't like:

-   small talks
    -   Why would people ask questions they don't want to know answers to?
-   mountain hiking
    -   Stay away from the activities reminding you that life is meaningless.

I now live on campus, and I have come to love the weather and the sea in Hong Kong. Even after being here for a while, I am still amazed by the beautiful scenes that I encounter every now and then. Sometimes, I go to the seaside at night to appreciate the wind, the starry sky, and the sound of the waves.


I enjoy sharing the campus with wild boars and dogs because they remind me that compared to them I'm an apeman.
