Even after being here for a while, I am still amazed by the beautiful scenes that I encounter every now and then. Sometimes, I go to the seaside at night to appreciate the wind, the starry sky, and the sound of the waves.\n\n\nI enjoy sharing the campus with wild boars and dogs because they remind me that compared to them I'm an apeman.\n\n::: center\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRHqs8SffDo width=\"200\" >}}\n:::\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lat=22.334, lng=114.265, popup=\"HKUST Business School\")\n```\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":false,"highlight-style":"monokai","output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","_quarto-vars":{"name":"Jia ZHANG","name_ch":"张佳","status":"Ph.D. Student in Finance","year":"2nd Year","school":{"full":"HKUST Business School","short":"HKUST"},"email":"jzhanggx@connect.ust.hk","url":"https://jiazhang42.github.io/mysite/","github":"https://github.com/JiaZhang42/mysite","page":{"copyright_year":"2023"}},"theme":{"light":["united","styles.scss"],"dark":["united","styles-dark.scss"]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
